    "description" : "The Standardized Vocabularies contains instances, or Concepts, that uniquely identify each fundamental unit of meaning used to express clinical information in all domain resources of the CDM. Concepts are derived from vocabularies, which represent clinical information across a domain (e.g. conditions, drugs, procedures) through the use of codes and associated descriptions. Some Concepts are designated Standard Concepts, meaning these Concepts can be used as normative expressions of a clinical entity within the OMOP Common Data Model and within standardized analytics. Each Standard Concept belongs to one domain, which defines the location where the Concept would be expected to occur within resource types of the CDM.  Concepts can represent broad categories (like 'Cardiovascular disease'), detailed clinical elements ('Myocardial infarction of the anterolateral wall') or modifying characteristics and attributes that define Concepts at various levels of detail (severity of a disease, associated morphology, etc.).  Instances in the Standardized Vocabularies are derived from national or international vocabularies such as SNOMED-CT, RxNorm, and LOINC, or custom Concepts defined to cover various aspects of observational data analysis. For a detailed description of these vocabularies, their use in the OMOP CDM and their relationships to each other please refer to the specifications.",
