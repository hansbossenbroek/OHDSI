    "description" : "The CONCEPT_ANCESTOR collection is designed to simplify observational analysis by providing the complete hierarchical relationships between Concepts. Only direct parent-child relationships between Concepts are stored in the CONCEPT_RELATIONSHIP collection. To determine higher level ancestry connections, all individual direct relationships would have to be navigated at analysis time. The CONCEPT_ANCESTOR collection includes instances for all parent-child relationships, as well as grandparent-grandchild relationships and those of any other level of lineage. Using the CONCEPT_ANCESTOR collection allows for querying for all descendants of a hierarchical concept. For example, drug ingredients and drug products are all descendants of a drug class ancestor.  This collection is entirely derived from the CONCEPT, CONCEPT_RELATIONSHIP and RELATIONSHIP collections.",
